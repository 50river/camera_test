# Task 3 Implementation Notes

## PaddleOCR ONNX エンジンの統合 - Completed

### 3.1 onnxruntime-web セットアップ ✅
- Configured onnxruntime-web with WASM backend
- Set up proper execution providers and session options
- Implemented model loading with error handling
- Added initialization status tracking and model info methods

### 3.2 PaddleOCR 検出モデル統合 ✅
- Implemented image preprocessing for detection (resize, normalize, NCHW format)
- Added detection inference with proper tensor handling
- Implemented postprocessing with bounding box extraction
- Added non-maximum suppression for merging nearby detections

### 3.3 PaddleOCR 認識モデル統合 ✅
- Implemented text region cropping from original images
- Added recognition preprocessing (32px height, variable width)
- Implemented recognition inference and result decoding
- Added Japanese character set for text decoding
- Implemented processRegion method for manual region selection

## Key Features Implemented

1. **WASM Backend Configuration**: Optimized for browser performance
2. **Two-Stage OCR Pipeline**: Detection → Recognition as per PaddleOCR architecture
3. **Image Processing**: Canvas-based resizing and format conversion
4. **Japanese Text Support**: Character set includes hiragana, katakana, kanji, and symbols
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Combined detection and recognition confidence scores

## Technical Details

- **Input Formats**: Detection [1,3,640,640], Recognition [1,3,32,320]
- **Output Processing**: Probability maps → bounding boxes → character sequences
- **Memory Management**: Proper tensor cleanup and canvas management
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Proper scaling between processed and original image coordinates

## Development Notes

- Placeholder ONNX models created for development
- In production, replace with actual PaddleOCR Japanese models
- Character dictionary should be loaded from PaddleOCR's official character set
- Detection postprocessing is simplified - production should use contour detection

## Next Steps

The OCR engine is now ready for integration with:
- Data extraction engine (Task 4)
- UI components for manual region selection (Task 6)
- Error handling and user feedback systems (Task 8)
